# Amazon Wishlist Database for Birthdays (and other special occasions)
A useful web app to help you find the right gifts for your friends. Money is nice, but a JBL Flip 4 Waterprrof Portable Bluetooth Speaker
would make such a better gift (*hint hint). 

# How to Use

This currently only works on the Canadian and US Amazon sites. The person's Amazon wishlist ID can be found in the url:

```
https://www.amazon.ca/hz/wishlist/ls/1H4NZDNEB37IN
```
In this wishlist url (which links to my personal wishlist), the wishlist ID corresponds to the 13 digits and letters at the 
end of the url. In this case, it's `1H4NZDNEB37IN`
